Smoke-Aware City Forecasting

 

A lightweight machine learning pipeline to forecast 24‑h ahead PM₂.₅ concentrations in Reno, NV, using satellite fire-hotspot counts and historical air-quality measurements.

🔍 Project Overview

Wildfire smoke is Reno’s major air-quality threat, driving spikes in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) that harm public health. This repository demonstrates a simple, reproducible workflow that:

Ingests hourly PM₂.₅ data from the OpenAQ v3 API (2015–2025).

Downloads daily satellite fire-pixel counts from NASA’s MODIS archive (2021–2025).

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with line plots and daily boxplots.

Establishes a naïve baseline (tomorrow = yesterday) with MAE ≈ 3.91 µg/m³.

Trains a Random Forest regressor on two features (fire-pixels + yesterday’s PM₂.₅), reducing MAE to ≈ 1.72 µg/m³.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smoke-aware-city.git
cd smoke-aware-city

2. Create the environment

Using Conda:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate smoke-aware-env

Or with venv + pip:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ingest data

Open notebooks/01_download.ipynb and run all cells to download PM₂.₅ and fire-pixel data.

Inspect data/ to verify that CSV files appear.

4. Explore and model

Sequentially run the EDA, baseline, and model notebooks:

notebooks/02_eda.ipynb

notebooks/03_baseline.ipynb

notebooks/05_model.ipynb

Each notebook prints metrics and displays key plots.

📈 Results

Baseline MAE (yesterday → tomorrow): 3.91 µg/m³

Random Forest MAE (with fire-pixels + previous PM₂.₅): 1.72 µg/m³

These results illustrate that satellite-detected fire activity is a strong predictor of next-day PM₂.₅.
